I achieve the add, sub, negative, multi, div, cos(), sin() function.

And for the add, sub, multi operation, I compute the polynamial to the simpest polynamial.

For the other function, I list as follow:
1. the solve the equation, like x+2=0, getting x=-2;
2. getting x value when funtion equal to y, like funtion y=x+2, then get x=y-2;
3. Polynamials Differentail; 
4. Polynamials Integral;
5 setting the x value to get funtion result, like function x+5, when x=1, output 6;
