# final-project

We combined our file into a header file and cpp file(main).

So far we have acheived the following functions:
1.  Build multivariable equations that include addition, subtraction, multiplication and division operations. And compute the polynomial to the simpest one.
    Addition eg. (10x-5)+(6x+5)=16x;
    Subtraction eg. -(-5+10x)=5-10x;
    Mutiplication eg. 5x*(5+x)=25x+5x^2;
    Division eg.  (5-10x)/(25+10x+x^2);
2.  Solve variable equations:
    eg. Solve x+2=0, get x=-2;
        when x=1 the result of Polynomial 5-10x is -5;
        the x of 5-10x=y can be solved as: x=(y-5)/(-10);
        Solve(25+10x+x^2=0), x=-5;
3.  Solve sin and cos.
4.  Solve polynomial differential and integral equation.
